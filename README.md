# Sequences_DSR
Material for the Sequences course at Data Science Retreat

In this repository are collected some resource used during the Sequences class at Data Science Retreat course, Berlin 2020. The other used resources are in the following repository: https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/teaching-monolith/tree/master/sequences.

*RNN_theano_from_scratch* and *LSTM_theano_from_scratch* are two implementation of RNN and LSTM used to deep dive into the mathematical details of these models. They make sense only if used in a live setting with a whiteboard. 

*LSTM_with_keras* contains an implementation of LSTM with Keras. 

*Sequence_processing_tactics_vs_strategy.pdf* contains a graphical overview of the algorithms that could be potentially used for sequences. 

Finally, the zip file *sequences_data* contains real life anonymised data that can be used to experiment with sequences. There are two csv files: eventlog and cases. The eventlog contains the single activities (or events) of a sequence; the caselog contains an entry for each sequence (so, mainly the ID of the sequences).
